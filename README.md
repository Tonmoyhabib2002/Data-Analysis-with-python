Insurance Premium Prediction
This project predicts insurance premiums based on customer demographics and health-related attributes using machine learning techniques. It explores the dataset, performs data analysis, and builds models to estimate insurance expenses.

Project Overview
Insurance premium prediction is important for insurance companies to evaluate risk profiles and set appropriate pricing. This notebook uses a publicly available dataset containing customer information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, alongside their insurance expenses. The goal is to predict medical insurance costs using these features.

Dataset
The dataset contains 1,338 records with the following features:

age: Age of the policyholder (numeric)

sex: Gender of the policyholder (male/female)

bmi: Body Mass Index (numeric)

children: Number of children covered by insurance (numeric)

smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)

region: Residential area in the US (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)

expenses: Annual medical insurance expenses (target variable)
